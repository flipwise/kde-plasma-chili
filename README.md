# Fili's Chili login theme for KDE Plasma

![Screenshot of the theme](preview.png "Preview")

Fili's Chili is mereley an adaptation of the [Chili theme](https://github.com/MarianArlt/kde-plasma-chili) based on my personal preferences and for my personal use.

This means:
- Lato as the default font
- Usernames are bolded
- Added code to turn off font hinting 
- Fontsizes were too big -> 10pt is everyhwere, only the username is 11pt
- Action buttons were too small -> set icon size to 48pt
- The height of the password box is slightly reduced because it was disproportionate with the height of the text in it
- The opacity of unselected action buttons is increased from 60% to 85%
